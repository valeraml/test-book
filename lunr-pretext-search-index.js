  "title": "Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration",
  "body": " Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration   A certain amount of mathematical maturity is necessary to find and study applications of abstract algebra. A basic knowledge of set theory, mathematical induction, equivalence relations, and matrices is a must. Even more important is the ability to read and understand mathematical proofs. In this chapter we will outline the background needed for a course in abstract algebra.  It helps when testing to know when this sample document was generated: , .    A Short Note on Proofs   Abstract mathematics is different from other sciences. In laboratory sciences such as chemistry and physics, scientists perform experiments to discover new principles and verify theories. Although mathematics is often motivated by physical experimentation or by computer simulations, it is made rigorous through the use of logical arguments. In studying abstract mathematics, we take what is called an axiomatic approach; that is, we take a collection of objects and assume some rules about their structure. These rules are called axioms . Using the axioms for , we wish to derive other information about by using logical arguments. We require that our axioms be consistent; that is, they should not contradict one another. We also demand that there not be too many axioms. If a system of axioms is too restrictive, there will be few examples of the mathematical structure.  A statement in logic or mathematics is an assertion that is either true or false. Consider the following examples:  .  All cats are black.  .  exactly when .  If and , then .  .  All but the first and last examples are statements, and must be either true or false.  A mathematical proof is nothing more than a convincing argument about the accuracy of a statement. Such an argument should contain enough detail to convince the audience; for instance, we can see that the statement exactly when is false by evaluating and noting that , an argument that would satisfy anyone. Of course, audiences may vary widely: proofs can be addressed to another student, to a professor, or to the reader of a text. If more detail than needed is presented in the proof, then the explanation will be either long-winded or poorly written. If too much detail is omitted, then the proof may not be convincing. Again it is important to keep the audience in mind. High school students require much more detail than do graduate students. A good rule of thumb for an argument in an introductory abstract algebra course is that it should be written to convince one's peers, whether those peers be other students or other readers of the text.  Let us examine different types of statements. A statement could be as simple as ; however, mathematicians are usually interested in more complex statements such as If , then , where and are both statements. If certain statements are known or assumed to be true, we wish to know what we can say about other statements. Here is called the hypothesis and is known as the conclusion . Consider the following statement: If and , then . The hypothesis is and ; the conclusion is . Notice that the statement says nothing about whether or not the hypothesis is true. However, if this entire statement is true and we can show that with is true, then the conclusion must be true. A proof of this statement might simply be a series of equations: .  If we can prove a statement true, then that statement is called a proposition . A proposition of major importance is called a theorem . Sometimes instead of proving a theorem or proposition all at once, we break the proof down into modules; that is, we prove several supporting propositions, which are called lemmas , and use the results of these propositions to prove the main result. If we can prove a proposition or a theorem, we will often, with very little effort, be able to derive other related propositions called corollaries .    Some Cautions and Suggestions  There are several different strategies for proving propositions. In addition to using different methods of proof, students often make some common mistakes when they are first learning how to prove theorems. To aid students who are studying abstract mathematics for the first time, we list here some of the difficulties that they may encounter and some of the strategies of proof available to them. It is a good idea to keep referring back to this list as a reminder. (Other techniques of proof will become apparent throughout this chapter and the remainder of the text.)  A theorem cannot be proved by example; however, the standard way to show that a statement is not a theorem is to provide a counterexample.  Quantifiers are important. Words and phrases such as only , for all , for every , and for some possess different meanings.  Never assume any hypothesis that is not explicitly stated in the theorem. You cannot take things for granted.  Suppose you wish to show that an object exists and is unique . First show that there actually is such an object. To show that it is unique, assume that there are two such objects, say and , and then show that .  Sometimes it is easier to prove the contrapositive of a statement. Proving the statement If , then is exactly the same as proving the statement If not , then not .  Although it is usually better to find a direct proof of a theorem, this task can sometimes be difficult. It may be easier to assume that the theorem that you are trying to prove is false, and to hope that in the course of your argument you are forced to make some statement that cannot possibly be true.   Remember that one of the main objectives of higher mathematics is proving theorems. Theorems are tools that make new and productive applications of mathematics possible. We use examples to give insight into existing theorems and to foster intuitions as to what new theorems might be true. Applications, examples, and proofs are tightly interconnected much more so than they may seem at first appearance.     Sets and Equivalence Relations   Set Theory  A set is a well-defined collection of objects; that is, it is defined in such a manner that we can determine for any given object whether or not belongs to the set. The objects that belong to a set are called its elements or members . We will denote sets by capital letters, such as or ; if is an element of the set , we write . is in the set   A set is usually specified either by listing all of its elements inside a pair of braces or by stating the property that determines whether or not an object belongs to the set. We might write for a set containing elements or if each in satisfies a certain property . For example, if is the set of even positive integers, we can describe by writing either . We write when we want to say that 2 is in the set , and to say that is not in the set .  Some of the more important sets that we will consider are the following: .   the natural numbers    the integers    the rational numbers    the real numbers    the complex numbers   We can find various relations between sets as well as perform operations on sets. A set is a subset of , written or , if every element of is also an element of . is a subset of For example, and . Trivially, every set is a subset of itself. A set is a proper subset of a set if but . If is not a subset of , we write ; for example, . Two sets are equal , written , if we can show that and .  It is convenient to have a set with no elements in it. This set is called the empty set and is denoted by . Note that the empty set is a subset of every set. the empty set  To construct new sets out of old sets, we can perform certain operations: the union  of two sets and is defined as and the intersection of and is defined by . the union of sets and the intersection of sets and If and , then . We can consider the union and the intersection of more than two sets. In this case we write and for the union and intersection, respectively, of the sets .   When two sets have no elements in common, they are said to be disjoint ; for example, if is the set of even integers and is the set of odd integers, then and are disjoint. Two sets and are disjoint exactly when .  Sometimes we will work within one fixed set , called the universal set . For any set , we define the complement of , denoted by , to be the set complement of the set  .  We define the difference of two sets and to be difference between sets and  .   Set Operations  Let be the universal set and suppose that . Then .     Let , , and be sets. Then  , , and ;  and ;  and ;  and ;  ;  .     We will prove (1) and (3) and leave the remaining results to be proven in the exercises.  (1) Observe that .  Also, .  (3) For sets , , and ,  A similar argument proves that .     De Morgan's Laws  Augustus De Morgan, 1806 1871  De Morgan's laws for sets   Let and be sets. Then  ;  .     (1) We must show that and . Let . Then . So is neither in nor in , by the definition of the union of sets. By the definition of the complement, and . Therefore, and we have .  To show the reverse inclusion, suppose that . Then and , and so and . Thus and so . Hence, and so .  The proof of (2) is left as an exercise.     Other Relations on Sets  Other relations between sets often hold true. For example, . To see that this is true, observe that .     Cartesian Products and Mappings  Given sets and , we can define a new set , called the Cartesian product of and , as a set of ordered pairs. That is, Cartesian product of sets and  .   Cartesian Products  If , , and , then is the set and .   We define the Cartesian product of sets to be . If , we often write for (where would be written times). ( times) For example, the set consists of all of 3-tuples of real numbers.  Subsets of are called relations . We will define a mapping Mapping Function or function Function definition of  from a set to a set to be the special type of relation where if for every element there exists a unique element . Another way of saying this is that for every element in , assigns a unique element in . We usually write or . Instead of writing down ordered pairs , we write or . The set is called the domain Function domain of of and is called the range Function range of or image of . We can think of the elements in the function's domain as input values and the elements in the function's range as output values.   Mappings and relations          Mappings  Suppose and . In we define relations and from to . The relation is a mapping, but is not because is not assigned to a unique element in ; that is, and .   Given a function , it is often possible to write a list describing what the function does to each specific element in the domain. However, not all functions can be described in this manner. For example, the function that sends each real number to its cube is a mapping that must be described by writing or .  Consider the relation given by . We know that , but is or 2? This relation cannot be a mapping because it is not well-defined. A relation is well-defined Well-defined map if each element in the domain is assigned to a unique element in the range.  If is a map and the image of is , i.e., , then is said to be onto Function onto or surjective Function surjective . In other words, if there exists an for each such that , then is onto. A map is one-to-one Function one-to-one or injective Function injective if implies . Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if implies . A map that is both one-to-one and onto is called bijective Function bijective .    One-to-One and Onto Mappings  Let be defined by . Then is one-to-one but not onto. Define by where is a rational number expressed in its lowest terms with a positive denominator. The function is onto but not one-to-one.   Given two functions, we can construct a new function by using the range of the first function as the domain of the second function. Let and be mappings. Define a new map, the composition Function composition of of and from to , by .   Composition of maps        Composition of Mappings  Consider the functions and that are defined in (top). The composition of these functions, , is defined in (bottom).     Composition is not Commutative  Let and . Then and . In general, order makes a difference; that is, in most cases .    Some Mappings Commute  Sometimes it is the case that . Let and . Then and .    A Linear Map  Given a matrix , we can define a map by for in . This is actually matrix multiplication; that is, . Maps from to given by matrices are called linear maps or linear transformations Linear transformation definition of .    A Permutation  Suppose that . Define a map by . This is a bijective map. An alternative way to write is . For any set , a one-to-one and onto mapping is called a permutation Permutation definition of of .     Let , , and . Then  The composition of mappings is associative; that is, ;  If and are both one-to-one, then the mapping is one-to-one;  If and are both onto, then the mapping is onto;  If and are bijective, then so is .     We will prove (1) and (3). Part (2) is left as an exercise. Part (4) follows directly from (2) and (3).  (1) We must show that . For we have .  (3) Assume that and are both onto functions. Given , we must show that there exists an such that . However, since is onto, there is an element such that . Similarly, there is an such that . Accordingly, .    If is any set, we will use or to denote the identity mapping Function identity from to itself. Define this map by for all . A map is an inverse mapping of if and ; in other words, the inverse function of a function simply undoes the function. A map is said to be invertible Function invertible if it has an inverse. We usually write for the inverse of . identity mapping inverse of the function   An Inverse Function  The function has inverse by .    Exponential and Logarithmic Functions are Inverses  The natural logarithm and the exponential functions, and , are inverses of each other provided that we are careful about choosing domains. Observe that and whenever composition makes sense.    A Matrix Inverse Yields an Inverse of a Linear Map  Suppose that . Then defines a map from to by . We can find an inverse map of by simply inverting the matrix ; that is, . In this example, and hence, the inverse map is given by . It is easy to check that . Not every map has an inverse. If we consider the map given by the matrix , then an inverse map would have to be of the form and for all and . Clearly this is impossible because might not be 0.    An Inverse Permutation  Given the permutation on , it is easy to see that the permutation defined by is the inverse of . In fact, any bijective mapping possesses an inverse, as we will see in the next theorem.     A mapping is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.    Suppose first that is invertible with inverse . Then is the identity map; that is, . If with , then . Consequently, is one-to-one. Now suppose that . To show that is onto, it is necessary to find an such that , but with . Let .  Conversely, let be bijective and let . Since is onto, there exists an such that . Because is one-to-one, must be unique. Define by letting . We have now constructed the inverse of .      Equivalence Relations and Partitions  A fundamental notion in mathematics is that of equality. We can generalize equality with equivalence relations and equivalence classes. An equivalence relation Equivalence relation on a set is a relation such that  for all ( reflexive property );  implies ( symmetric property );  and imply ( transitive property ).   Given an equivalence relation on a set , we usually write instead of . If the equivalence relation already has an associated notation such as , , or , we will use that notation.   Equivalent Fractions  Let , , , and be integers, where and are nonzero. Define if . Clearly is reflexive and symmetric. To show that it is also transitive, suppose that and , with , , and all nonzero. Then and . Therefore, . Since , . Consequently, .    An Equivalence Relation From Derivatives  Suppose that and are differentiable functions on . We can define an equivalence relation on such functions by letting if . It is clear that is both reflexive and symmetric. To demonstrate transitivity, suppose that and . From calculus we know that and , where and are both constants. Hence, and . Therefore, .    Equivalent Circles  For and in , define if . Then is an equivalence relation on .    Equivalent Matrices  Let and be matrices with entries in the real numbers. We can define an equivalence relation on the set of matrices, by saying if there exists an invertible matrix such that . For example, if , then since for . Let be the identity matrix; that is, . Then ; therefore, the relation is reflexive. To show symmetry, suppose that . Then there exists an invertible matrix such that . So . Finally, suppose that and . Then there exist invertible matrices and such that and . Since , the relation is transitive. Two matrices that are equivalent in this manner are said to be similar Matrix similar .   A partition Partitions  of a set is a collection of nonempty sets such that for and . Let be an equivalence relation on a set and let . Then is called the equivalence class Equivalence class of . We will see that an equivalence relation gives rise to a partition via equivalence classes. Also, whenever a partition of a set exists, there is some natural underlying equivalence relation, as the following theorem demonstrates.    Given an equivalence relation on a set , the equivalence classes of form a partition of . Conversely, if is a partition of a set , then there is an equivalence relation on with equivalence classes .    Suppose there exists an equivalence relation on the set . For any , the reflexive property shows that and so is nonempty. Clearly . Now let . We need to show that either or . Suppose that the intersection of and is not empty and that . Then and . By symmetry and transitivity ; hence, . Similarly, and so . Therefore, any two equivalence classes are either disjoint or exactly the same.  Conversely, suppose that is a partition of a set . Let two elements be equivalent if they are in the same partition. Clearly, the relation is reflexive. If is in the same partition as , then is in the same partition as , so implies . Finally, if is in the same partition as and is in the same partition as , then must be in the same partition as , and transitivity holds.      Two equivalence classes of an equivalence relation are either disjoint or equal.    Let us examine some of the partitions given by the equivalence classes in the last set of examples.   A Partition of Fractions  In the equivalence relation in , two pairs of integers, and , are in the same equivalence class when they reduce to the same fraction in its lowest terms.    A Partition of Functions  In the equivalence relation in , two functions and are in the same partition when they differ by a constant.    A Partition of Circles  We defined an equivalence class on by if . Two pairs of real numbers are in the same partition when they lie on the same circle about the origin.    A Partition of Integers  Let and be two integers and suppose that . We say that is congruent Congruence modulo to  modulo  , or is congruent to mod , if is evenly divisible by ; that is, for some . In this case we write . is congruent to modulo For example, since is divisible by 8. We claim that congruence modulo forms an equivalence relation of . Certainly any integer is equivalent to itself since is divisible by . We will now show that the relation is symmetric. If , then is divisible by . So is divisible by and . Now suppose that and . Then there exist integers and such that and . To show transitivity, it is necessary to prove that is divisible by . However, , and so is divisible by .  If we consider the equivalence relation established by the integers modulo 3, then .  Notice that and also that the sets are disjoint. The sets , , and form a partition of the integers.  The integers modulo are a very important example in the study of abstract algebra and will become quite useful in our investigation of various algebraic structures such as groups and rings. In our discussion of the integers modulo we have actually assumed a result known as the division algorithm, which will be stated and proved in .      References and Suggested Readings     Artin, M.

  "body": " One Dimensitional Kinematics  The Integers   The integers are the building blocks of mathematics. In this chapter we will investigate the fundamental properties of the integers, including mathematical induction, the division algorithm, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.    Mathematical Induction and Math in a Title  Suppose we wish to show that for any natural number . This formula is easily verified for small numbers such as , 2, 3, or 4, but it is impossible to verify for all natural numbers on a case-by-case basis. To prove the formula true in general, a more generic method is required.  Suppose we have verified the equation for the first cases. We will attempt to show that we can generate the formula for the th case from this knowledge. The formula is true for since . If we have verified the first cases, then .  This is exactly the formula for the th case.  This method of proof is known as mathematical induction . Instead of attempting to verify a statement about some subset of the positive integers on a case-by-case basis, an impossible task if is an infinite set, we give a specific proof for the smallest integer being considered, followed by a generic argument showing that if the statement holds for a given case, then it must also hold for the next case in the sequence. We summarize mathematical induction in the following axiom.   First Principle of Mathematical Induction  Induction first principle of   Let be a statement about integers for and suppose is true for some integer . If for all integers with , implies that is true, then is true for all integers greater than or equal to .      An Inequality for Powers of  For all integers , . Since , the statement is true for . Assume that for . Then . But since is positive. Hence, by induction, the statement holds for all integers .    Some Integers Divisible by  Every integer is divisible by 9 for . For , is divisible by 9. Suppose that is divisible by 9 for . Then is divisible by 9.    The Binomial Theorem  We will prove the binomial theorem using mathematical induction; that is, , where and are real numbers, , and is the binomial coefficient. We first show that . This result follows from .   factorial    binomial coefficient   If , the binomial theorem is easy to verify. Now assume that the result is true for greater than or equal to 1. Then .   We have an equivalent statement of the Principle of Mathematical Induction that is often very useful.   Second Principle of Mathematical Induction  Induction second principle of   Let be a statement about integers for and suppose is true for some integer . If imply that for , then the statement is true for all integers .     A nonempty subset of is well-ordered Well-ordered set if contains a least element. Notice that the set is not well-ordered since it does not contain a smallest element. However, the natural numbers are well-ordered.   Principle of Well-Ordering   Every nonempty subset of the natural numbers is well-ordered.    The Principle of Well-Ordering is equivalent to the Principle of Mathematical Induction.    The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies that is the least positive natural number.    Let . Then . Now assume that ; that is, . Since , ; hence, by induction, every natural number is greater than or equal to 1.        The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies the Principle of Well-Ordering. That is, every nonempty subset of contains a least element.    We must show that if is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers, then contains a least element. If contains 1, then the theorem is true by . Assume that if contains an integer such that , then contains a least element. We will show that if a set contains an integer less than or equal to , then has a least element. If does not contain an integer less than , then is the smallest integer in . Otherwise, since is nonempty, must contain an integer less than or equal to . In this case, by induction, contains a least element.     Induction can also be very useful in formulating definitions. For instance, there are two ways to define , the factorial of a positive integer .  The explicit definition: .  The inductive or recursive definition: and for .   Every good mathematician or computer scientist knows that looking at problems recursively, as opposed to explicitly, often results in better understanding of complex issues.    The Division Algorithm   An application of the Principle of Well-Ordering that we will use often is the division algorithm.   Division Algorithm  Division algorithm for integers   Let and be integers, with . Then there exist unique integers and such that where .    This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof. We must first prove that the numbers and actually exist. Then we must show that if and are two other such numbers, then and .  Existence of and . Let . If , then divides , and we can let and . If , we can use the Well-Ordering Principle. We must first show that is nonempty. If , then . If , then . In either case . By the Well-Ordering Principle, must have a smallest member, say . Therefore, , . We now show that . Suppose that . Then . In this case we would have in the set . But then , which would contradict the fact that is the smallest member of . So . Since , and so .  Uniqueness of and . Suppose there exist integers , , , and such that . Then . Assume that . From the last equation we have ; therefore, must divide and . This is possible only if . Hence, and .    Let and be integers. If for some integer , we write . An integer is called a common divisor of and if and . The greatest common divisor Greatest common divisor of two integers of integers and is a positive integer such that is a common divisor of and and if is any other common divisor of and , then . divides greatest common divisor of and We write ; for example, and . We say that two integers and are relatively prime if .    Let and be nonzero integers. Then there exist integers and such that . Furthermore, the greatest common divisor of and is unique.    Let . Clearly, the set is nonempty; hence, by the Well-Ordering Principle must have a smallest member, say . We claim that . Write where . If , then , which is in . But this would contradict the fact that is the smallest member of . Hence, and divides . A similar argument shows that divides . Therefore, is a common divisor of and .  Suppose that is another common divisor of and , and we want to show that . If we let and , then . So must divide . Hence, must be the unique greatest common divisor of and .       Let and be two integers that are relatively prime. Then there exist integers and such that .      The Euclidean Algorithm  Among other things, allows us to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers.   Greatest Common Divisor of Two Integers  Let us compute the greatest common divisor of and . First observe that .  Reversing our steps, 105 divides 420, 105 divides 525, 105 divides 945, and 105 divides 2415. Hence, 105 divides both 945 and 2415. If were another common divisor of 945 and 2415, then would also have to divide 105. Therefore, .  If we work backward through the above sequence of equations, we can also obtain numbers and such that . Observe that .  So and . Notice that and are not unique, since and would also work.   To compute , we are using repeated divisions to obtain a decreasing sequence of positive integers ; that is, .  To find and such that , we begin with this last equation and substitute results obtained from the previous equations: .  The algorithm that we have just used to find the greatest common divisor of two integers and and to write as the linear combination of and is known as the Euclidean algorithm Euclidean algorithm Algorithm Euclidean .    Prime Numbers  Let be an integer such that . We say that is a prime number Prime integer , or simply is prime , if the only positive numbers that divide are 1 and itself. An integer that is not prime is said to be composite Composite integer .   Euclid   Let and be integers and be a prime number. If , then either or .    Suppose that does not divide . We must show that . Since , there exist integers and such that . So . Since divides both and itself, must divide .     Euclid   There exist an infinite number of primes.    We will prove this theorem by contradiction. Suppose that there are only a finite number of primes, say . Let . Then must be divisible by some for . In this case, must divide , which is a contradiction. Hence, either is prime or there exists an additional prime number that divides .      Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic   Let be an integer such that . Then , where are primes (not necessarily distinct). Furthermore, this factorization is unique; that is, if , then and the 's are just the 's rearranged.    Uniqueness. To show uniqueness we will use induction on . The theorem is certainly true for since in this case is prime. Now assume that the result holds for all integers such that , and , where and . By , for some and for some .

Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer . One problem in number theory is to find a function such that is prime for each integer . Pierre Fermat (1601? 1665) conjectured that was prime for all , but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707 1783) that is a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture. In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of 2 seemed to be the sum of two primes: , , , . Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through , it has yet to be proven in general. Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.      Sage Exercises   These exercises are about investigating basic properties of the integers, something we will frequently do when investigating groups. Use the editing capabilities of a Sage worksheet to annotate and explain your work.    Use the next_prime() command to construct two different 8-digit prime numbers and save them in variables named a and b .    Use the .is_prime() method to verify that your primes a and b are really prime.    Verify that is the greatest common divisor of your two primes from the previous exercises.    Find two integers that make a linear combination of your two primes equal to . Include a verification of your result.    Determine a factorization into powers of primes for .    Write a compute cell that defines the same value of c again, and then defines a candidate divisor of c named d . The third line of the cell should return True if and only if d is a divisor of c . Illustrate the use of your cell by testing your code with and in a new copy of the cell, testing your code with .     Programming Exercises  The Sieve of Eratosthenes Sieve of Eratosthenes  One method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a certain fixed positive integer is to list all of the numbers such that . Begin by eliminating all of the multiples of 2. Next eliminate all of the multiples of 3. Now eliminate all of the multiples of 5. Notice that 4 has already been crossed out. Continue in this manner, noticing that we do not have to go all the way to ; it suffices to stop at . Using this method, compute all of the prime numbers less than . We can also use this method to find all of the integers that are relatively prime to an integer . Simply eliminate the prime factors of and all of their multiples. Using this method, find all of the numbers that are relatively prime to . Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, write a program that will compute all of the primes less than an integer .
